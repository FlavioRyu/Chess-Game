### Chess Board Game (OOP in C++) - short descrption

A chess game program was written in C++ making use of the advantages of Object-Oriented Programming such as encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. It is designed to be played by two players that interact with the game using the terminal (or console if the .exe file is launched), where the chess board is displayed after each player move. The code successfully implements all the major rules of the game including pawn promotion and castling. The game is terminated when a checkmate or a stalemate is detected.  


More info and detailed features (a rather thorough explanation) about all the classes and functions used can be found in the `Chess_Report.pdf` file!
